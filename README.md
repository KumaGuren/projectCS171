# projectCS171
Hey all,

I created this small project in my Computer Systems class in my first year of college based on "A sustainable environment".

--The objective--

When you run this FINAL_PROJECT_CS171 file you'll see sources of energy and near them, you'll see 2 distinct letters for each of them.
There are also 2 semi-circles; one red and one green (green says renewable, and the red says non-renewable).

The letters on the left are non-renewable, while the letters on the right are renewable. All letters you see on the screen are unique and won't be repeated.

when you click the right letter for the right source of energy, the PNG image of the energy source disappears and either the non-renewable/renewable count increases. One thing that will always increase/decrease whether you get it right or wrong is the score count. This tracks your score and the highest score you should be able to achieve is the numerical value of 10.

Have fun :)
